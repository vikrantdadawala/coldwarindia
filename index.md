__India and the Cold War__ is a curated digital repository that revisits the global Cold War from a postcolonial point of view. This month, we are featuring archival material from the *Peopleâ€™s War*, the central organ of the Communist Party of India (CPI) from August 1942 through November 1945.

Read more about the *People's War* and its times [here](/coldwarindia/exhibits/a/) and [here](/coldwarindia/exhibits/b/). Or, simply browse through the material yourself to discover how a whole generation of Indians, in a time of war and famine, found themselves captivated by the tantalizing dream of a possible "Soviet India"!
