<h1> Who is this project by? </h1>

__India and the Cold War__ builds on original research by [Vikrant Dadawala](https://www.english.upenn.edu/people/vikrant-dadawala), a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania.

<h1> What is its purpose? </h1>

Among the largest and first countries to be liberated from colonial rule following the end of World War II, India had been a key symbolic battleground between the forces of "socialism" and "capitalism" during the first three decades following its Independence (1947-77).

Yet, for a number of reasons, India continues to occupy a strange blindspot in our understanding of Cold War history. This project seeks to recover the now forgotten ways in which the political, economic, cultural and military history of modern India (and of the larger South Asia region) was shaped by the Cold War.
